# Facial Recognition API

## General Overview
Project included creating an API that is used for facial recognition. The API was created in NodeJS and currently contains two functions. One is to verify if a face is known, the other is to add a known face to the database. A python file was created that handled the actual comparison of the faces. This python script is called by the API. A webpage made from HTML and PHP was created to test the project by capturing images via a webcam and sending them to the API via a POST request. A database was also created with MySQL to store references to known faces.

This project demonstrates knowledge and understanding of how APIs operate. It shows how APIs are created and how they can be used by other web apps to simplify operations and gather information. It also shows an understanding of how to properly communicate between different programs to seemlessly create an application.
